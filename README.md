What the project does? 

Ecogreen seeks to link agropreneurs with ready markets while ensuring safety and traceability of product origins and history. It also seeks to train participants in green technologies by keeping them abreast with emerging trends hence ensuring economic sustainability as well.

Why the project is useful? 

In Nigeria and Africa in general, there has been a constant record of wastage of agricultural produce due to inability of producers to reach their end consumers timely. Having both producers and consumers on this platform would ensure that there's a ready uptake of products as they are made available with both parties being secured in the transaction from start to finish.

How users can get started with the project? 

A user platform would be created where both agropreneurs and consumers can sign-up under either category. The platform would utilize blockchain technology to ensure the safety of both parties for every transaction initiated on the platform. The safety of produce is also guaranteed as each step the of the transaction and inputs can be viewed in real-time.

Where users can get help with your project? 

A 24-hour user helpdesk will be deployed using a chatbot which would be programmed to resolve queries from platform users. Where further assistance is required, queries will be forwarded to contributors as well as platform administrators for resolution.

Who maintains and contributes to the project? 

Contributions would be from research institutes on emerging trends in agriculture, environmental specialists and advocates with emphasis on green technologies and emerging trends in same, logistics industry captains who would leverage their industry know-how and financial experts to ensure transparency in the payments.  Maintenance would be in-house or outsourced.
